  </h3>
  <p>
    Suppose we have a parent component that consists of several sections (child components).
    Each section has its own unique id (#anchor) and is at least 800px high.
    An absolute link to an anchor allows you to quickly navigate to the desired section.
    In other words, using the link "href=#anchor" we can move between sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's assume that the user followed an absolute link to the first section.
    The user then followed an absolute link to the second section.
    In the second section, the user opened the GlnDatepicker component panel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, the user presses a button on the "Back" panel (go to the previous link, i.e. return to the
    first section).
    The panel of the GlnDatepicker component from the second section will open on the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    This happens because the component of the second section was not destroyed and there was no
    event to close the open panel of the GlnDatepicker component.
    In this case, the parent component was not explicitly scrolled.
    Although all GlnDatepicker components were set to "block scroll" when the panel was open, it
    didn't work in this case.
    And since the GlnDatepicker component's panel is rendered on its own layer of the "body"
    element, this results in an overlay of the first section and the open GlnDatepicker component's
    panel of the second section.
    (This issue arose while developing this demo page.)
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve this problem, you need:
  </p>
  <span>
    1. set the scroll event handler for the parent component;
  </span>
  <code><pre source="html">
&lt;div style="height: 100%; overflow-y: auto;"
  (scroll)="doScroll()"&gt;
  &lt;div class="main-side-content"&gt;
    &lt;section id="section1"&gt;
      &lt;app-section1&gt;&lt;/app-section1&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section id="section2"&gt;
      &lt;app-section2&gt;
        ...
        &lt;gln-datepicker&gt;&lt;/gln-datepicker&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/app-section2&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></code>
  <br />
  <code><pre source="ts">
export class SiteComponent &#123;
  public doScroll(): void &#123;
    // Close an open panel.
    GlnDatepickerOpenUtil.closeAll();
  &#125;
&#125;</pre></code>
  <p>
    2. close the open panel of the GlnDatepicker component;
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a static class GlnDatepickerOpenUtil, which contains a list of all GlnDatepicker components
    with an open panel.
    Calling the static method "closeAll()" will gracefully close all open panels.
  </p>
