    When the input parameter is true or "empty string", the current element is
    given the "auto-focuse" attribute.
    This allows you to check the correct operation of this directive.

    The directive allows you to transfer the input focus to the specified element with a
    complex page structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The directive defines the first nested child GlnAutoFocuse directive with a positive
    input parameter value (or "empty string").
    And after that, it calls the method of the child directive GlnAutoFocuse to transfer
    the input focus.
  </p>
  <p>
    This directive is placed as close as possible to the root of the current page.
    This is necessary to get the "OnAfterViewInit" hook at the moment when all child
    elements have already been rendered.
    In other words, it is required to determine the moment when the current page has
    completed its rendering.
